## Usage

### Building

- Install the `cargo risczero` tool and the `risc0` toolchain:

```console
$ cargo install cargo-risczero
$ cargo risczero install --version v2024-02-08.1
```
- Install the `cargo prove` tool and the `succinct` toolchain:

```console
$ curl -L https://sp1.succinct.xyz | bash
$ sp1up
$ cargo prove --version
```

- For SGX, install gramine: https://github.com/gramineproject/gramine. If you're running ubuntu 22.04 (or a compatible distro) you can just download and install this deb file: https://packages.gramineproject.io/pool/main/g/gramine/gramine_1.6.2_amd64.deb

- Clone the repository and build with `cargo`:

```console
$ cargo build
```

### Running

Run the host in a terminal that will listen to requests:

Just for development with the native prover:
```
cargo run
```

Then in another terminal you can do requests like this:

```
./prove_block.sh taiko_a7 native 10
```

Look into `prove_block.sh` for the available options or run the script without inputs and it will tell you.

You can also automatically sync with the tip of the chain and prove all new blocks:

```
./prove_block.sh taiko_a7 native sync
```

## Provers

Provers can be enabled using features. To compile with all of them (using standard options):

```
cargo run --release --features "risc0 sp1"
```

### risc zero

Build using
```
make risc0
```

#### Testing
```
RISC0_DEV_MODE=1 cargo run --release --features risc0
```

#### Bonsai
```
# edit run_bonsai.sh and run
run_bonsai.sh
# then
prove_block.sh taiko_a7 risc0-bonsai 10
```

#### CPU
```
cargo run --release --features risc0
```

#### GPU

```
cargo run -F cuda --release --features risc0
```
OR
```
cargo run -F metal --release --features risc0
```

CUDA needs to be installed when using `cuda`: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html

### SP1:
```
make sp1
cargo run --release --features sp1
```

### SGX:
```
make sgx
cargo run --release --features sgx
```

Make sure to first do a cargo build because cargo run does not build the sgx binary!

If your CPU doesn't support SGX, you can still run the SGX code through gramine like it would on an SGX machine:

```
SGX_DIRECT=1 cargo run --release --features sgx
```
